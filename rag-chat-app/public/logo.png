# Logo Placeholder

Since we can't directly create a binary image file through this interface, you'll need to:

1. Find or create a logo image (preferably a PNG with transparent background)
2. Save it as `logo.png` in the `rag-chat-app/public/` directory
3. Make sure it's an appropriate size (recommended: 120x40px)

Alternatively, you can modify the `App.vue` file to remove the logo reference or use a different image path.
